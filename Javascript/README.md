##### Object Oriented Programming
Following items have been demonstrated that are widely used while implementing object oriented progamming in javascript:
* Encapsulation.
* Abstraction.
* Adding or removing data members.
* Object enumeration.
* Referencing (By Value & By Reference)
* Getter and Setters
***
### Running The Examples
Running js scripts is quite easy and when sourced inside an html file you just need to open the file in browser. I recommend using Chrome browser because I like the Chrome Developer Tools. 
Once that file is loaded into the browser, go to the "Console" panel in Chrome Developer Tools and see the result for each of the scripts added into the html file. The fun part is that you can play with the variables and objects in the console, once the file is loaded.
